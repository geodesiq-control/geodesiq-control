## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- Duplicate code in verification of `filtered_pulse`.
- Possibility to directly call `PulseControl`. Instead, use `ControlModel` to create a control model and then call
  `ControlModel.synthesize_pulse()` to obtain the pulse control, and later use the provided methods.
- Access of private attributes of `ControlModel` in `Dynamics`.

### Added

- Validate `hamiltonian` and `partial_hamiltonian` for shape, values, ... .
- Better comparison between previous and new `parameters` to check if the eigenproblem must be solved again.
- `gitattributes` file to fix line endings as LF for all files.
- `ControlModel.parameters` to obtain a read-only view of the parameters.

### Fixed

- Validation of parameters in `filtered_pulse`.
- Modify Hatch to only include the source files in the package, not the tests and other files.
